        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> Pork stew is a hearty dish made with chunks of pork meat, vegetables, and broth. It's typically slow-cooked to make the meat nice and tender. You can add all sorts of vegetables to your pork stew, like potatoes, carrots, onions, and peas.  Some people even like to add fruit like apples or prunes! </p>
        
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>

            <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon butter </li>
            <li> 1 large onion, chopped </li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 1 bay leaf </li>
            <li> ¾ teaspoon caraway seed </li>
            <li> 1 (12 fluid ounce) bottle dark beer (such as Guinness) </li>
            <li> 2 cups chicken broth </li>
            <li> 3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces </li>
            <li> 2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces </li>
            <li> ¼ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley </li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar </li>
            <li> 12 Brussels sprouts, halved </li>
            <li> 3 cups mashed potatoes, or as needed </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, for garnish </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Season pork with salt and black pepper. </li>
            <li> Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Working in batches, cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl. </li>
            <li> Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter with a pinch of salt until onion is softened and translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
            <li> Stir flour into onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is completely incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add bay leaf and caraway seed; cook for 2 minutes more. Pour in beer. Cook and stir until thickened, 1 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li> Stir browned pork, broth, carrots, and celery into beer mixture; bring to a simmer. Stir 1/4 cup parsley and balsamic vinegar into stew; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until pork is fork-tender, about 2 hours. </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook Brussels sprouts in boiling water until almost tender, about 5 minutes. Drain. </li>
            <li> Stir Brussels sprouts into stew and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. </li>
            <li> Divide mashed potatoes between 6 bowls. Ladle stew over potatoes and garnish with 1 teaspoon parsley. </li>
        </ol>
